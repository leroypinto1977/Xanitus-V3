# Xanitus Portfolio - Sanity CMS Setup Guide

## Current Status

Your Xanitus portfolio website is now running with:

- âœ… Navbar and Footer on all pages
- âœ… Sample blog posts and portfolio items
- âœ… Working Next.js application at http://localhost:3000
- âœ… Sanity Studio accessible at http://localhost:3000/studio

## Sample Content

The application currently uses sample data located in `/data/sampleData.ts` which includes:

- 4 blog posts with full content
- 4 portfolio projects with detailed information
- Sample technologies and categories

## Sanity CMS Setup (Optional)

To connect to a real Sanity CMS for content management:

### Option 1: Create Your Own Sanity Project

1. **Go to https://sanity.io and create an account**
2. **Create a new project** in the Sanity dashboard
3. **Copy your Project ID** from the project settings
4. **Update the environment variables** in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id-here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
   ```

### Option 2: Continue with Sample Data

You can continue using the sample data and manually update it in `/data/sampleData.ts` as needed.

## Adding Content

### To Add Blog Posts (using sample data):

1. Open `/data/sampleData.ts`
2. Add new blog post objects to the `sampleBlogPosts` array
3. Follow the existing structure for consistency

### To Add Portfolio Projects (using sample data):

1. Open `/data/sampleData.ts`
2. Add new project objects to the `sampleProjects` array
3. Include technologies, images, and detailed descriptions

## Accessing the Sanity Studio

Visit http://localhost:3000/studio to access the Sanity Studio interface.

**Note**: To use the studio with your own Sanity project, you'll need to:

1. Set up your own Sanity project (Option 1 above)
2. Configure authentication
3. Import the sample data or create content manually
